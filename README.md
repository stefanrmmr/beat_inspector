Fundamental Analytics for any uploaded Beat!
This streamlit-based web application is aimed at music producers and artists who are frequently working with prebuilt audio files or beats. The inherent pain-point of having to do fundamental audio analytics such as identifying bpm rates, musical scales and audio file conversions are automated by using "beat_inspector". 

To insure that the implemented functionality provides real value to aspiring artists, "beat_inspector" has been implemented in close cooperation with the Linz-Austria-based "[Utility Studio](https://utility-studio.com/)" (music production studio with a focus on recording and vocal editing services)
