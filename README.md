Fundamental Analytics for any uploaded Beat!
This streamlit-based web application is aimed at music producers and artists who are frequently working with prebuilt audio files or beats. The inherent pain-point of having to do fundamental audio analytics such as identifying bpm rates, musical scales and audio file conversions are automated by using "beat_inspector". 

To insure that the implemented functionality provides real value to aspiring artists, "beat_inspector" has been implemented in close cooperation with the Linz-Austria-based [Utility Studio](https://utility-studio.com/)™ <br/>(music production studio with a focus on recording and vocal editing services)


### Functionality Overview
- Musical Attributes Analytics (BPM rate classification, Musical scale detection)
- Technical Overview (Audio file format, quality, resolution, trackId, meta data)
- Audio File Format Processing
  - Meta information encoded in the output file
  - Conversion to .wav file with predefined settings<br/>(provided by using convertio.co's API features)
